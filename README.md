  - firstTask display the first two blocks of 4 digits on one line.
  - secondTask display the document number, but replace blocks of three letters with *** (each letter will be replaced with *).
  - thirdTask display only one letter from the document number in the format yyy/yyy/y/y in lowercase.
  - fourthTask display the letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyy/y/y" in uppercase (implemented using the StringBuilder class).
  - fifthTask check whether the document number contains the sequence "abc" and whether the message contains it or not (and abc and ABC are considered the same sequence).
  - sixthTask check if the document number begins with the sequence 555.
  - seventhTask check whether the document number ends with the sequence 1a2b.
